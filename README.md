## Terminal

### ‚ûú ~ [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)

![Terminal Theme](https://i.imgur.com/fkuEbq7.png)

#### Theme

I use the **[Tomorrow Night Blue](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme/blob/master/OS%20X%20Terminal/Tomorrow%20Night%20Blue.terminal)** theme, with a [modified](https://github.com/ChristianJHughes/devTools/blob/master/terminal/Tomorrow%20Night%20Blue.terminal) ANSI color profile that matches the [VSCode theme](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-tomorrow-night-blue) of the same name.

#### Extensions

- [**git**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugin:git) - Provides a ton of useful `git` aliases.
- [**npm**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/npm) - Provides a ton of useful `npm` aliases
- [**osx**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/osx) - Shortcuts for Mac tasks -- `showFiles`, `hideFiles` and `quick-look` will change your life.
- [**yarn**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/yarn/yarn.plugin.zsh) - Aliases and autocomplete for `yarn`. `yarn` -> `y` & `yarn add` -> `ya`.
- [**node**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/node) - Adds `node-docs` command for launching the docs of whatever version of `node` is running.
- [**colored-man-pages**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/colored-man-pages) - Adds color highlighting to `man` pages so that you can actually read them.
- [**zsh-autosuggestions**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) (**essential**) - Automatically suggests commands that you've run before, based on your history.
- [**z**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/z) (**essential**) - It's like `cd` except 100x smarter. Do you have a `dev` directory that you're always going to? Type `z dev` from *anywhere* *in the file system* and it will take you right there.
- [**zsh-syntax-highlighting**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) (**essential**) - Adds syntax highlighting to all commands *as you type them*.

#### Emulator

The mighty **[terminal.app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS))** is my go-to because of its *speed* and *reliabilty*.

**[Hyper](https://hyper.is)** is installed because it has cute plugins, and is great to look at. I want to love it, but it's too janky to use as a daily driver. I'll probably try to switch once the project is more mature.

### Command Line Tools

The [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/) include many common utilties such as `git` and `gcc`.

#### Via `homebrew`

`brew list && brew cask list`

- [**node**](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [**screenfetch**](https://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch)

#### Via `yarn` & `npm`

## Desktop Tools

I do all of my personal and profesional work on a [15" Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) (2016 or 2017) running [macOS High Sierra](https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra/).

### System Enhancements

- [**Alfred 3**](https://www.alfredapp.com) - It's like Spotlight on steroids. It's a ‚ö°Ô∏è fast app launcher, üìÅ file searcher, and üíª system shorcut tool. Plus, it seamlessly integrates with 1Password and your browser bookmarks.

![Alfred](https://i.imgur.com/fdvy7dM.png)

- [**ToothFairy**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toothfairy/id1191449274?mt=12) - I love my airpods, but digging through the Bluetooth menu to connect them is a first-world hastle. ToothFairy gives you a one click shortcut!

![ToothFairy](https://i.imgur.com/L5hqIGh.png)

- [**Vanilla**](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) - Is your menu bar getting cluttered? Vanilla will hide the icons that you rarely use.

![Vanilla](https://i.imgur.com/wa0OBzl.png)

- [**Amphetamine**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) - Keep your Mac from sleeping with a button in the menu bar. Don't do drugs, kids!

![Amphetamine](https://i.imgur.com/ScOIxYX.png)

- [**Magnet**](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com) - Adds window snapping and resizing with simple keyboard shortcuts ([Specatcle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) is a good free open-source alternative).

![Magnet](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/98/c6/ff/98c6ff8e-1d13-1a2b-5946-6bcd1aff8451/pr_source.png/643x0w.png)

- [**Rocket**](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) - Add emotions anywhere by using the `:` shortcut, just like in [Slack](https://slack.com) üéâ!

### Programming

- [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com) - GitHub's desktop client. It's good for viewing visual diffs, but I use the command line (or VSCode) 90% of the time.
- [**Lepton**](https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton) - An open-source [gist](https://gist.github.com) manager. It's not much of a looker, but it gets the job done.
- [**Atom**](https://atom.io) - A text-editor by GitHub. This was my daily driver for almost two-years before switching to VSCode. I think VSCode is more mature for daily development, but I keep Atom around to keep up with its new releases.
- [**XCode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Apple's IDE for Apple's OS's. I use it rarely use it right now.
- [**CodeRunner**](https://coderunnerapp.com) - A lightweight IDE that can run a ton of different lanugages. I use it for writing quick Java and Python scripts.

### Productivity

- [**Things 3**](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - The best To-Do list app in existence. I have obsessively tried tons of to-do list style apps, and this one is my favorite by a large margin. It's clean, powerful, and reliable. Pricey but worth it.
- [**Pages, Keynote, & Numbers**](https://www.apple.com/iwork/) - Don't make me use Office.
- [**Slack**](https://slack.com) - I started using Slack in March 2018, and it's quickly become my favorite chat client.
- [**Discord**](https://discordapp.com) - Discord is the best cross-platform *voice* chat that I've ever used.

### Utilities

- [**1Password**](https://1password.com) - The best password manager for mac. The UX is consistantly great, and the development team is constantly releasing improvements.
- [**AppCleaner**](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - Dragging an app to the trash doesn't *really* delete an app in macOS. This handy app will fully remove apps that you're not using anymore.
- [**ImageOptim**](https://imageoptim.com/mac) - Open-source painless image optimization. A must-have when working with images being published to the web.
- [**CleanMyMac 3**](https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac) - The best app for removing junk files, cleaning out caches, and fixing permission issues. Just turn off the garbage helper tool.
- [**PDF Toolkit+**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-toolkit/id545164971?mt=12) - Performs all sorts of useful actions on PDF documents. I frequently use it to stich multiple PDFs together.

### Browsers

I use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for work, and [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) for play. The Chrome Dev Tools are next level, but Safari is cleaner and has better OS itegration.

#### Safari Extensions

- [**1Password**](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.agilebits.onepassword4-safari-2BUA8C4S2C) - Seamless password autofilling.
- [**Wipr**](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.giorgiocalderolla.wipr-desktop-4449XA862Y) - Super light weight and open-source ad-blocker and tracking prevention.
- [**Instapaper**](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.instapaper.extension-CAM49M58WK) - Minimalist reading list.

#### Chrome Extensions

- [**1Password X**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-%E2%80%93-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa) - Seamless password autofilling.
- [**Bookmarks Bar Switcher**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmarks-bar-switcher/lcaelgondnfehcambmdhhfokjknhfahc) - Allows you to swap out your bookmarks bar at will -- I use it to seperate my **personal** and **work** bookmarks.
- [**Instapaper**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instapaper/ldjkgaaoikpmhmkelcgkgacicjfbofhh) - Minimalist reading list.
- [**LastPass**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd) - Useful for when other LastPass users have passwords to share. Otherwise, I stick to 1Password.
- [**Fireshot**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg) - Takes seamless full-page screenshots.
- [**Better Jira**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-jira/adjlkmhgnjccbagimdppnminndehkmgl) - Makes Jira much more presentable for stand-ups.
