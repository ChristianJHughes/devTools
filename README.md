#### Theme

I use the **[Tomorrow Night Blue](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme/blob/master/OS%20X%20Terminal/Tomorrow%20Night%20Blue.terminal)** theme, with a [modified](https://github.com/ChristianJHughes/devTools/blob/master/terminal/Tomorrow%20Night%20Blue.terminal) ANSI color profile that matches the [VSCode theme](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-tomorrow-night-blue) of the same name.

#### Extensions

- [**git**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugin:git) - Provides a ton of useful `git` aliases.
- [**npm**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/npm) - Provides a ton of useful `npm` aliases
- [**osx**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/osx) - Shortcuts for Mac tasks -- `showFiles`, `hideFiles` and `quick-look` will change your life.
- [**yarn**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/yarn/yarn.plugin.zsh) - Aliases and autocomplete for `yarn`. `yarn` -> `y` & `yarn add` -> `ya`.
- [**node**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/node) - Adds `node-docs` command for launching the docs of whatever version of `node` is running.
- [**colored-man-pages**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/colored-man-pages) - Adds color highlighting to `man` pages so that you can actually read them.
- [**zsh-autosuggestions**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) (**essential**) - Automatically suggests commands that you've run before, based on your history.
- [**z**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/z) (**essential**) - It's like `cd` except 100x smarter. Do you have a `dev` directory that you're always going to? Type `z dev` from *anywhere* *in the file system* and it will take you right there.
- [**zsh-syntax-highlighting**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) (**essential**) - Adds syntax highlighting to all commands *as you type them*.

#### Emulator

The mighty **[terminal.app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS))** is my go-to because of its *speed* and *reliabilty*.

**[Hyper](https://hyper.is)** is installed because it has cute plugins, and is great to look at. I want to love it, but it's too janky to use as a daily driver. I'll probably try to switch once the project is more mature.

### Command Line Tools
